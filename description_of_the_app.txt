Description of the PD-Tracking-App-hackthepandemic
==================================================

1) What characteristics the app should have
===========================================

  a) OpenSource development
     With OpenSource anyone can have a look on the programming code, to insure
     i) the app is only doing what it is intended
     ii) developing, testing and bugfixing could be done faster
     iii) no additional not needed data for the main functionality is collected
     iiii) functionality and collecting data is transparent for everyone
  
  b) Data is collected anonymously
     No personal data is stored about the person who is using the app.
     There is no need for. 
     For example, Bluetooth-MAC-Adresses should be encrypted with a one-way-cryptographic function,
     so it isn't possible to recover the origin one.
     For telling people that they have met a covid-19-patient, there is no need for knowing the person in real life.
  
  c) Using Bluetooth for tracking
     With Bluetooth we can simple detect other devices nearby. 
     The range of Bluetooth is limited and any smartphone has it.
     So we do not track people, just their devices. In fact, nowadays with smartphones that seems to be similiar, but is not.
  
  d) Data is only stored non-centralized
     No extra data storage is needed, so no one could claim it. 
     i) The tracking data is stored on the single device of the user
     ii) The tracking data is stored in a blockchain. So everyone can have it, analyze it and do whatever they want.
  
  e) Positive Tests of diseases like corona-19, flu, ebola and so on could be processed anonymously,
     also the information if you had contact with such a person.
     
  f) The collection of data concerning positive disease-tests has to be safe.
     This seems the most challenging act. Only if you have trustworthy data about this the whole thing makes sense.
  
2) Basic thoughts about the app
===============================

  a) The app should be free with no charge
  b) using it should be on a voluntary basis
  c) no additional data should be collected
  
  Many people would use it, I guess, if the above is followed.
