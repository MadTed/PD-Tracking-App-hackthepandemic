# PD-(Pandemic Disease-) Tracking-App-hackthepandemic

The Covid-19 virus pandemic is overhelming us in many cases.

Without a tracking of infected people and their contacts you could not handle it, if you want to reopen.

So I start to develop an app for tracking the spread of diseases in general, starting with covid-19 and Android.

The main characteristics of the app are:

1) OpenSource developement
2) transparent and fully anonymous way to collect and process data. No personal data is used. No movement profile is created.
3) storing the data decentralized in a blockchain
4) only verified health status is used, provided by your local health service

Let's go to work!

Best wishes,
